/* Purpose:  ThirdPartyAppsMaster.css is...

   REMINDER:  Best to apply edits to ThirdPartyAppsMaster.css directly on
   production server, as the strategy is to post samples referencing
   fully qualified URL at all times.  In other words, there is no benefit to
   editing ThirdPartyAppsMaster.css locally as it cannot be unit tested there
   anyway.

/* Assumes majority of layout accomplished by series of .css files sitting in the root of the
City of Berkeley public web site.  Thus, the CSS definitions below are customizations that
are 100% intended for 3rd party applications only, and not for the public web site itself.
The main benefit of doing this is that we can completely localize background image filenames
and paths from the application that uses these CSS definitions.  Very cool!  (EYang, May 2008)
